# ricecooker

The arch ricecooker. It installs the programs I use on arch along with my
dotfiles. It'll work on any new install with some prerequisites:

1. `sudo` and `git` should be installed
2. `rc_vars.sh` should be filled out

`rc_vars.sh` contains a few variables that need to be filled out before running
the script.

If the prerequisites are met, cloning the repo and running `ricecooker.sh`
should do all the work on it's own. A couple of password prompts will appear,
but that's all.
